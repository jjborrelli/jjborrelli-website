I apply <font style='color:#3e72bc; font-size:1.25rem'>network theory</font> and tools to answer ecological questions about <font style='color:#3e72bc; font-size:1.25rem'>community structure</font> and <font style='color:#3e72bc; font-size:1.25rem'>dynamics</font>. Network tools can help to define and understand how interactions between species in a community are patterned. Using the structure of the interaction network as the backbone of a <font style='color:#3e72bc; font-size:1.25rem'>dynamical model</font> allows me to simulate the changes in population size over time. One of my primary interests is in studying how different trophic configurations in food webs relate to <font style='color:#3e72bc; font-size:1.25rem'>stability</font> at the community and population level.    

  
And as always...

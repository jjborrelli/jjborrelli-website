At RPI I am working with the [Jefferson Project at Lake George](https://jeffersonproject.rpi.edu/) to develop and analyze models of the lake food web. We are collaborating with IBM Research to integrate these food web models with detailed hydrological models of Lake George to build an understanding of how changes in the lake's ecosystem will cascade through the ecological community.

*Trophic* is an R package I am working on to compile functions for generating food web structures. It currently has 9 different methods available to generate adjacency matrices. 

I have several goals for this work beyond simply generating food web structures. I hope to implement methods developed by Allesina et al. to determine the likelihood that an observed food web was generated using a specific algorithm. 

I also plan to link this package to models of food web dynamics, in order to make it easier to generate and simulate food webs for testing theory.
